# GPS Tracking Demo - Multiple sensors with realistic GPS tracks
# Use case: Fleet tracking, fitness tracking, wildlife monitoring
#
# Features various transport modes with realistic GPS track playback:
# - Walk: Person walking in Berlin Tiergarten
# - Cycle: Cyclist in Berlin
# - Drone: Survey drone (local area)
#
# All sensors start in Berlin area for better visualization.
# Playback speeds are set for reasonable demo movement (1-3x real time).
# GPS sampling at 1Hz (once per second)
