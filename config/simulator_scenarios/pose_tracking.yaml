# Pose Tracking Demo - Simulated skeleton/pose estimation sensors
# Use case: Testing skeleton visualization without real cameras
#
# Motion types available:
# - idle: Subtle breathing and sway
# - walking: Walking cycle with arm swing
# - waving: Right hand wave
# - jumping: Jump animation
# - dancing: Hip sway and arm groove
# - exercise: Squats, arm raises, side stretches
